      I am Elijah Andrews. I am currently attending General Assembly's Software-Engineering program. I have worked with HTML, Javascript and CSS. Prior to my time at GA, I worked as a Shift-lead Manager at Starbucks for about a year. 
    <p class="about-bio">From August 2021, until February of 2022, I lived in the country of Albania, where I did volunteer work. I helped to provide continued disaster relief from a major earthquake that hit the country in 2019, as well as worked in a food program that provided basic necessities for people in need. </p>
